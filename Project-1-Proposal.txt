My selection for the news analyzer will be on the topic of sports, and more specifically on the sport of hockey and the NHL.
The data will come from the NewsAPI (newsapi.org) with a free developer API key. 
This poses some annoying limitations on the number of articles that I can pull from the API at a time (100 results per API query is the main one), but I feel I can work around this.
I will also be limited to articles from the last month because of the limited license, but this still provides me with tens of thousands of articles to analyze.
I will use Hive to answer the questions.
Analysis Questions:
1. Is news about hockey increasing over the last month?
2. What team(s) have the most news about them?
3. Which of these popular players shows up in news the most: Alex Ovechkin, Sidney Crosby, or Connor McDavid?
4. How does volume of news about hockey compare to news about other popular sports in the US, basketball, football, baseball?
5. What division has the most news about it (Metro, Atlantic, Central, or Pacific)?
6. How has the NHL's newest team, the Seattle Kraken fared in terms of volume of news over the last month?
